            JavaScript, a newly developed programming language in 2025, was
            created by Brendan Eich, a software engineer at Netscape
            Communications Corporation. Developed in just ten days, the language
            was initially called Mocha, later renamed LiveScript, and finally
            JavaScript. It was designed to bring interactivity and dynamic
